## Conclusion

This MVP represents a strategic balance between immediate utility and long-term potential. By starting with core functionality that delivers immediate value, we establish a foundation for sophisticated research capabilities while maintaining the simplicity that makes the tool accessible to all researchers.

The success of this approach depends on maintaining user focus throughout development, resisting feature creep that doesn't serve real workflows, and building a sustainable development process that can respond to the evolving needs of the digital humanities research community.

The tool's ultimate success will be measured not by feature completeness, but by its ability to enable researchers to document, preserve, and share knowledge about stained glass heritage more effectively than any existing alternative.
